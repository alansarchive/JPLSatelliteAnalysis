# Python-Satellite-Telemetry

Created an operational and data analysis of an equatorial earth-imaging satellite. Pretty cool experience but the satellite(Lunar Trailblazer) it was for lost connection with mission control and is now just floating in space LOL. Goodbye 50 million American taxpayer dollars.
